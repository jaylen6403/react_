                                    Alternatively, on the 10th and subsequent anniversaries, the owner may elect to

                                    benefit. Highest anniversary value step-ups are applicable until the anniversary
                                    prior to the owner's 91st birthday. Excess withdrawals reduce the benefit base
                                    and withdrawal amount proportionately. Annual benefit payment will be equal to
                                    RMD amount if it is greater than the maximum amount that can be withdrawn in a
                                    single contract year, provided that owner is enrolled in automated distribution
                                    program. RMDs will not be considered excess withdrawals.

                                    Alternatively, on the 10th and subsequent anniversaries, the owner may

                                    purchase payments made within 120 days of contract issue less proportionate
                                    withdrawals.
                                    If this portion of the benefit is exercised, the entire benefit is
                                    terminated.
                                    In addition, there is an optional death benefit that may be elected
                                    in conjunction with this benefit.
                                    Highest anniversary value step-ups are applicable until the anniversary
                                    prior to the owner's 91st birthday.
                                    Excess withdrawals reduce the benefit base and withdrawal amount proportionately.
                                    Annual benefit payment will be equal to RMD amount if it is greater than the
                                    maximum amount that can be withdrawn in a single contract year.
                                    RMDs will not be considered excess withdrawals.

                                    Annual Charge: 1.350% assessed annually and calculated against the benefit base.<br>

                                    Fee percentage may increase upon optional step-up. Benefit is based on life(lives)

                                    Automatic step-up on each anniversary until the contract anniversary prior
                                    to the owner's 91st birthday. The owner will have the opportunity to decline the
                                    automatic step-ups if the benefit expense percentage increases. Automatic
                                    step-ups may be reinstated.
                                    On each contract anniversary, the benefit base is
                                    compounded at 5% until the 10th contract anniversary (provided no withdrawals
                                    were taken in the current year).
                                    Cannot have in conjunction with any other
                                    living benefit or the Earnings Preservation Benefit.
                                    Must allocate according to Option A or Option B.
                                    Allocations to Option B must be in Platform 1 (max. 70%) and Platform 2 (min. 30%).
                                    See prospectus for details.
                                    Quarterly rebalancing is automatic for Option B. The change of an owner for any
                                    reason will terminate
